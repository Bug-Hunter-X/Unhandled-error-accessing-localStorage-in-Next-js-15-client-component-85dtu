# Next.js 15 localStorage Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered in Next.js 15 applications when attempting to access `localStorage` within a client component before the client-side rendering occurs. The issue specifically arises because `localStorage` is not accessible on the server-side during the initial render of the page. 

## Problem

The provided `about.js` attempts to access and parse data from `localStorage` directly. This causes an error on the server-side since `localStorage` is only available in a browser environment.  The error will be visible in the browser's console and may result in a broken page or unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The `aboutSolution.js` demonstrates a solution by using a conditional rendering to only access `localStorage` after the component mounts in the browser.  This ensures that `localStorage` is available before access is attempted.
